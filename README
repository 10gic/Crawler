This simple web crawler (written in C++, only works in Windows) is ported from
another open source crawler Larbin.
Larbin Homepage: http://larbin.sourceforge.net/index-eng.html

However, Larbin only works under Linux-like system.

The main work in this project is migrating "poll" system call in Linux to
Windows I/O Completion Ports (IOCP).
